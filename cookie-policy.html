device (computer, tablet, smartphone) when you visit a website. They help
websites recognize your device, remember your preferences, and improve your
experience. How I Use Cookies I use cookies for one purpose only: Analytics and
Performance: I use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors
use my website. This includes data like the pages you visit, how long you stay,
how you arrived at the site, and your general geographic location (not your
exact address). This information helps me understand how my website is used so I
can improve it over time. Google Analytics may set cookies on your device to
collect this information. The data collected is aggregated and anonymous â€” it
does not identify you personally. You can learn more about how Google uses
